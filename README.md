## üìå Background & Overview

### Objective
üìñ **What is this project about? What Business Questions will it solve?**

This project is a hands-on SQL exercise utilizing the Google Analytics sample dataset on BigQuery. The primary goal is to extract key e-commerce insights to help business managers better understand customer journeys and optimize operations.

The project aims to answer critical business questions, including:
*   How do key metrics like website visits, pageviews, and transactions trend monthly?
*   What is the bounce rate per traffic source, and which sources are most/least effective?
*   How does revenue vary by traffic source, both weekly and monthly?
*   What are the differences in browsing behavior (average pageviews) between purchasers and non-purchasers?
*   For purchasing users, what is their average number of transactions?
*   What is the average revenue generated per session for purchasing users?
*   Which products are frequently purchased together, indicating cross-selling opportunities?
*   How do customers progress through the purchasing funnel (view ‚Üí add to cart ‚Üí purchase), and what are the conversion rates?

üë§ **Who is this project for?**
*   Data Analysts & Business Analysts
*   E-commerce Managers & Strategists
*   Marketing Professionals
*   Decision-makers & Stakeholders interested in e-commerce performance.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Main Process: Data Preparation, SQL Analysis & Insights

This project involved key data preparation and analysis steps performed directly via SQL queries in Google BigQuery. Detailed SQL scripts for each task are available in the `/sql_queries` directory.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation & Preprocessing (Performed via SQL)
Key data preparation steps embedded within the SQL queries included:
*   **Schema Traversal:** Navigating nested fields (e.g., `hits`, `hits.product`) using `UNNEST()`.
*   **Data Type Handling:** Converting `productRevenue` to its actual monetary value.
*   **Filtering:** Selecting data by date ranges and specific conditions (e.g., `totals.transactions >=1`).
*   **Metric Calculation:** Deriving metrics like bounce rate and conversion rates.
*   **Session & User Identification:** Utilizing `fullVisitorId` and `visitId`.
